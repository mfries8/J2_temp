# Parking Lot (Deferred Items)

Tasks that remain valuable but are deferred beyond Phase 0. Revisit these when planning future iterations.

## Tooling & Automation
- Create GitHub Actions workflow running lint, type, and tests on push/PR.
- Document lint/type/test shortcuts (Makefile or Poetry scripts) and add VSCode tasks/settings for common commands.
- Extend README/docs with VSCode setup, CI overview, and DevTools responsibilities tie-in.

## Notes
- Keep this list synced with phase status documents.
- When pulling an item back into an active phase, remove it from this list and update the relevant status file.
