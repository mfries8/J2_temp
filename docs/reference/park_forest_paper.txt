             Abstract–The fireball accompanying the Park Forest meteorite fall (L5) was recorded by ground-
             based videographers, satellite systems, infrasound, seismic, and acoustic instruments. This meteorite
             shower produced at least 18 kg of recovered fragments on the ground (Simon et al. 2004). By
             combining the satellite trajectory solution with precise ground-based video recording from a single
             site, we have measured the original entry velocity for the meteoroid to be 19.5 ± 0.3 km/s. The earliest
             video recording of the fireball was made near the altitude of 82 km. The slope of the trajectory was
             29° from the vertical, with a radiant azimuth (astronomical) of 21° and a terminal height measured by
             infrared satellite systems of 18 km. The meteoroid’s orbit has a relatively large semi-major axis of
             2.53 ± 0.19 AU, large aphelion of 4.26 ± 0.38 AU, and low inclination. The fireball reached a peak
             absolute visual magnitude of −22, with three major framentation episodes at the altitudes of 37, 29,
             and 22 km. Acoustic recordings of the fireball airwave suggest that fragmentation was a dominant
             process in production of sound and that some major fragments from the fireball remained supersonic
             to heights as low as ~10 km. Seismic and acoustic recordings show evidence of fragmentation at 42,
             36, 29, and 17 km. Examination of implied energies/initial masses from all techniques (satellite
             optical, infrasound, seismic, modeling) leads us to conclude that the most probable initial mass was
             (11 ± 3) × 103 kg, corresponding to an original energy of ~0.5 kt TNT (2.1 × 1012 J) and a diameter
             of 1.8 m. These values correspond to an integral bolometric efficiency of 7 ± 2%. Early fragmentation
             ram pressures of <1 MPa and major fragmentations occurring with ram pressures of 2–5 MPa suggest
             that meter-class stony near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) have tensile strengths more than an order of
             magnitude lower than have been measured for ordinary chondrites. One implication of this
             observation is that the rotation period for small, fast-rotating NEAs is likely to be >30 seconds.

frame-by-frame integrated pixel intensity values for one of the indirect videos showing most of the major features visible across the entire set
of videos. The thin line is the normalized light curve from the U.S. DoE sensor data. Some of the features visible in the video data (notably
B2 and B3) may be artifacts of the auto-gain control of the video systems. The time in seconds is relative to March 27, 2003 05:50:26.4 UT.

Table 4. Properties of seismic signal arrivals and associated modeling results. The arrival notations are as shown in Fig.
7. Arrival times are in UT on March 27, 2003. The origin height is the point along the fireball trajectory where acoustic
emission is determined to most closely match the observed delay time from modeling. The signal type indicates whether
the best-match modeled waveform is stratospherically or thermospherically ducted, while Dev is the angular deviation in
degrees away from the perpendicular for rays launched from the best-fit altitude. The delay time has been corrected for
the finite fireball velocity and is referenced to the main burst at the altitude of 29 km.
